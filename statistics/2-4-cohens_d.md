>> CohenEffectSize(firsts['prglngth'],others['prglngth'])

>> CohenEffectSize(firsts['totalwgt_lb'],others['totalwgt_lb'])

>> Then sign and magnitude are different for these two variables. For pregnancy length we get 0.02 and for total weight we get -0.08. The difference between the first babys and the other babys is larger for total weight than it is for pregnancy length. Also, the total weight of babys in the first group are smaller (negative sign) than the other group, where the other group's pregnancy length is smaller than the first group (positive sign).
